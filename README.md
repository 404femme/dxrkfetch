## 🖤 what is dxrkfetch?

`dxrkfetch` is a minimal and moody system info tool for **Linux** and **macOS** — a fork of cute nonsense turned into a sharper, darker utility.
It displays system stats (OS, kernel, uptime, shell, etc.) in a clean, ASCII-powered format — built for **dark terminals**, **noir moods**, and **dead-eyed productivity**.

---

## features ⚙️

* 🐧 Built for **Linux** and **macOS**
* 🩻 ASCII logos — glitchcore, distro-accurate
* ⏳ Uptime, kernel, shell, packages, and user info
* ☕ Bundled JRE — no runtime dependencies
* 🚫 No color vomit. No bloat. No bullshit.
